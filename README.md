The code is based on the flowchart of rou_g/miu_g-MOEA constraints handling method. The proposed method is used during the selection process to find a better solution considering constraints viloations and number of violated constraints. alfa is the output refering to the selction results. The method is divided into two stages, namely rou_g-based stage and miu_g-based stage.
"main_rou_miu" is the main function of the framework, which need to be used in the selection process of the MOEA.
Some of functions and parameter settings should be written by users based on their own needs.
The MOEA code is necessary before the application of this method.
